In this first player endless runner game, the player is supposed to be a car in space. 
The main goal is to avoid pedestrians and cats that appear in the middle of the road, while the speed of the player increases every time the player succesfully avoids them. 
When the player gets a highscore, they are rewarded with a random picture of a cat.
Instructions for movement and further details are included.
